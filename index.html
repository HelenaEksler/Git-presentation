		<p>
			 Coding conventions are a set of guidelines for a specific programming
       language that recommend programming style, practices, and methods for
       each aspect of a program written in that language.
		<br/>
		<br/>
      When we learn a new language, we usually begin to code in a specific style.
      In most cases, we’ll write in a style that we want, not one that has been
      suggested to us. But once we start to code using a particular style, like
      a spoken language dialect, it will become second nature — we’ll use that
      style in everything we create. Such a style might include the conventions
      we use to name variables and functions ($userName, $username or $user_name
      for example), and how we comment our work. Any style should ensure that we
      can read our code easily.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      It is not that hard to read some small peace of code, but when we get to
			the large collaborated projects - no standards makes this code unreadable
			for everybody.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Following coding standards makes our code readable for other developers
      which is important when you work in team. And it makes it easier to
      understand what is going on in the code after some time.

		<p class="headline">Indenting and Whitespace</p>
		<p>
			Indentation is not a requirement of most programming languages, where it
			is used as secondary notation. Rather, programmers indent to better convey
			he structure of their programs to human readers. In particular, indentation
			is used to show the relationship between control flow constructs such as
			conditions or loops and code contained within and outside them.
			<br/>
			There are several widly used options for indentetion: 2 spaces, 4 spaces and tab.
			But I would suggest to use 2 spaces, since it won't bring your line far to
			the right if you have a lot of levels, and will stay same for all editors
			and systems.
			<br/>
			Besides indentation - we should separate different blocks with empty lines.
			So space should be between functions, classes etc. Also it's nice to
			separate blocks inside one function.

<code>
function some_funct() {
return TRUE;
}
function main() {
$test = some_funct();
if ($test) {
for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
if ($check = some_funct()) {
$result[] = $i * 2;
}
else {
$result[] = $i * 3;
}
}
}
return $result;
}



</code>
<code>
function some_funct() {
	return TRUE;
}

function main() {
	$test = some_funct();
	if ($test) {
		for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
			if ($check = some_funct()) {
				$result[] = $i * 2;
			}
			else {
				$result[] = $i * 3;
			}
		}
	}
	return $result;
}

		<p class="headline">Operators</p>
		<p>
      All binary operators (operators that come between two values), such as
      <b>+, -, =, !=, ==, >, etc.</b> should have a space before and after the operator, for readability.
		</p>
<code>
$a=($b+$c/2)!=$d;
</code>
<code>
$a = ($b + $c / 2) != $d;
</code>
		<p class="headline">String Concatenations</p>
    <p>
      Always use a space between the dot and the concatenated parts to improve readability.
      <br/>
      When you concatenate simple variables, you can use double quotes and add the variable inside; otherwise, use single quotes.
      <br/>
      When using the concatenating assignment operator ('.='), use a space on each side as with the assignment operator.
    </p>
<code>
$string='Foo'.$bar;
$string.='Foo'.'bar';

</code>
<code>
$string = 'Foo' . $bar;
$string = 'foo' . 'bar';
$string = "Foo $bar";
</code>
<code>
$string .= 'Foo';
$string .= $bar;
$string .= baz();

</code>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
    <p class="headline">Quotes</p>
    <p>
      PHP doesn't have strict rules about which quotes to use, like for example JAVA.
      If you are following for example Drupal coding standards - we should use
      single quotes. There are 2 exceptions:
      <br/>1. Deliberate in-line variable interpolation.
      <br/>2. Translated strings where one can avoid escaping single quotes by enclosing the string in double quotes.
    </p>
<code>
$foo = 'Hello, world!';
$bar = "Hello, $name!";
$val = "Hello, it's nice to meet you!";
// Instead of 'Hello, it\'s nice to meet you!'
</code>
    <p class="headline">Casting</p>
    <p>
      Put a space between the (type) and the $variable in a cast:
    </p>
    <code>(int) $mynumber</code>
	</section>

	<section class="slide">
		<p class="headline">Control Structures</p>
		<p>
      Control statements should have one space between the control keyword and
      opening parenthesis, to distinguish them from function calls.
      <br/>
      Always use curly braces even in situations where they are technically
      optional. Having them increases readability and decreases the likelihood
      of logic errors being introduced when new lines are added. The opening
      curly should be on the same line as the opening statement, preceded by
      one space. The closing curly should be on a line by itself and indented to
      the same level as the opening statement.

  action1;

elseif (condition3 && condition4) {
